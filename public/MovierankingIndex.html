<h1>The Best Movies According to Mr. Sinay</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Hobbit (Trilogy)</h3>
<p>My favourite movie trilogy of all-time. I love the storyline and the whole LOTR world and scenery.</p>
<h3>Star Wars (saga)</h3>
<p>On a shared firstplace with The Hobbit, the star wars saga is one of the greatest stories ever filmed. Also with very great series available, its an all-time greatest for me.</p>
<h3>Lord Of The Rings (saga)</h3>
<p>It's kind of the same principle as with the movies mentioned above, for me these movies are the best ones available.</p>
